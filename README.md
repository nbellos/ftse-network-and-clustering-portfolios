# Network and Hierarchical Portfolios on the FTSE 100

This project compares portfolio construction methods on FTSE 100 equities, examining whether network-based and hierarchical clustering approaches that exploit correlation structures can deliver more robust out-of-sample risk–return profiles than classical Markowitz optimization. Using daily data from 2015–2025, we build portfolios calibrated on 2015–2017 and evaluate their performance over 2018–2025 against the FTSE 100 benchmark.
